Deployment
AWS Elastic Beanstalk:

Description: Provides an easy-to-use service for deploying and managing applications which automatically handles deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and scaling.
Key Features: Supports various programming languages, integrates with other AWS services, automates resource provisioning based on application requirements.
AWS CodeDeploy:

Description: Automates code deployments to any instance, including Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. It allows you to quickly release new features, helps avoid downtime during deployment, and handles the complexity of updating applications.
Key Features: Supports rolling updates, blue/green deployments, integrates with CI/CD pipelines, and provides detailed deployment logs and metrics.
AWS CodePipeline:

Description: Provides continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service that automates the build, test, and deploy phases of your release process. It allows you to create workflows and automate the deployment of applications.
Key Features: Integrates with various AWS and third-party services, supports custom plugins, provides visualization of the entire pipeline.
Elasticity
Auto Scaling:

Description: Automatically adjusts the number of Amazon EC2 instances in your Auto Scaling group based on traffic demand or a defined schedule. It helps maintain application availability and allows you to scale capacity up or down seamlessly.
Key Features: Supports scaling based on metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, network traffic), integration with Elastic Load Balancing, custom scaling policies, and predictive scaling.
Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and AWS Fargate:

Description: ECS allows you to run and manage Docker containers at scale on Amazon EC2 instances or with AWS Fargate (a serverless compute engine for containers). It simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications.
Key Features: Supports task definitions, integrates with Docker and Kubernetes, manages container orchestration, and scales containers based on application demand.
AWS Lambda:

Description: Allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales based on the number of requests and runs your code in response to events. Lambda is ideal for microservices architectures and event-driven applications.
Key Features: Supports multiple programming languages, integrates with other AWS services, scales automatically, and charges based on the number of requests and compute time.
