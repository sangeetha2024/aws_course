Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your IP address range, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways.

AWS Direct Connect: Establishes a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS. It enables you to bypass the public internet and achieve consistent network performance, potentially reducing costs and increasing bandwidth throughput.

AWS Transit Gateway: Allows you to connect thousands of VPCs and on-premises networks using a single gateway. It simplifies network architecture and management by acting as a hub that interconnects your VPCs and remote networks.

Amazon Route 53: A scalable domain name system (DNS) web service designed to route end users to internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into IP addresses.

AWS VPN (Virtual Private Network): Allows you to securely connect your on-premises network or individual devices to your VPCs. It uses industry-standard IPsec VPN connections, providing secure access to your AWS resources.

AWS CloudFront: A fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to your viewers with low latency and high transfer speeds.

AWS Global Accelerator: Improves the availability and performance of your applications with the AWS global network. It directs traffic to optimal endpoints over AWS's global network infrastructure, minimizing latency and increasing throughput.

AWS PrivateLink: Enables you to securely access AWS services by keeping all the network traffic within the AWS network. It simplifies the security posture and compliance profile for applications that are shared with other AWS accounts.
