Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Provides scalable computing capacity in the cloud, allowing you to launch virtual servers (instances) with various operating systems and configurations.

Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service): Supports running and managing Docker containers at scale, either on EC2 instances or using AWS Fargate, which is a serverless compute engine for containers.

AWS Lambda: Allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. It automatically scales based on the incoming requests and you pay only for the compute time consumed.

Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): A managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of Kubernetes clusters on AWS.

AWS Batch: Enables you to run batch computing workloads on AWS, dynamically provisioning the optimal quantity and type of compute resources based on the volume and specific resource requirements of the batch jobs submitted.

Amazon Lightsail: Provides virtual private servers, storage, and networking for a low, predictable price. It is designed to be an easy-to-use cloud platform that offers you everything needed to build an application or website.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Makes it easy for you to deploy and manage applications in the cloud without worrying about the infrastructure that runs those applications. It automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, to scaling.

AWS Outposts: Extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to virtually any customer datacenter, co-location space, or on-premises facility for a truly consistent hybrid experience.
